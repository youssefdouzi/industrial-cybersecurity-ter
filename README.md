Master research project on OT cybersecurity (2025)

# OT Cybersecurity – Master Research Project (2025)

> Master's degree research project (TER) conducted during my FSI (Fiabilité et Sécurité Informatique) program at Aix-Marseille University.

## Project Overview

This project focused on the analysis of industrial systems (OT) security:
- Study of SCADA/ICS vulnerabilities
- Application of the Purdue model, MITRE ATT&CK, Pain Pyramid
- Simulation of attacks (DDoS, MITM) in ICS environments
- Tools used: Factory IO, ICSSIM, Modbus TCP

## Deliverables

- `rapport_TER.pdf` – Full technical report (in French)
- 7 reports that were weekly conducted
- Summary of observed attack paths and mitigations

## Technologies & Concepts

- Industrial communication protocols (Modbus TCP)
- Cyber threat models (MITRE ATT&CK)
- Industrial system environments simulation tools (Factory IO, ICSSIM)
- SCADA/ICS architecture and segmentation
